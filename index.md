# Direct Link to Test Code

The links below take you directly to the test code.   The directory structure parallels the structure of a `main` directory with the same folders and source code files.  This is a standard convention for Java projects built with Maven; we have chosen to structure our JavaScript code in the same way for consistency.  Thus, each source code file should have a corresponding set of tests.
